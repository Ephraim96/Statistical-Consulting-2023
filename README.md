Contains R code and data from 2023 statistical consulting project. 
The code consists of:

1) Visualization and exploratory analysis of the geochemical data using techniques such as PCA and Linear Discriminant Analysis.
2) Fitting statistical models such as Multinomial Logistic Regression, Lasso Multinomial Logistic Regression, and Linear Discriminant Analysis to the data for classification.

All classification models use geochemical variables as predictors and MapUnit as the response.
